AnimaTechCreator
----------------------------
The goal is to have a UI application that simplefies creating a "Technique" from the TTRPG (Table Top Role Playing Game) Anima Beyond Fantasy.
UI elements will also be established that allow the user to add and modify any "Effects" a Technique is allowed to use.  Data will be stored in 
flat files. 

Language: C#/.Net (Core) 8
Project built in: Visual Studio 2022

State of Project: 
There are effectively two projects in this archive. 
-The main project (/AnimaTechCreator.sln): This project currnetly has some of the sub UserControls in development that will be used in the main application.

-The previous project (/backup/AnimaTechCreator.sln): This project has the most current design for what the main application will look like. The UI elements here 
 are meant to eventually be ported into the main project, with modification, to fit in with the new projects better style/orginization.
